# Traffic Flow Forecast

A machine learning project for predicting traffic flow patterns using time series analysis.

## Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts traffic flow data to help understand vehicle patterns and predict future traffic conditions.

## Files

- `T7_193_SMT_Traffic_flow_forecast.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and forecasting model
- `traffic.csv` - Dataset containing traffic flow data

## Getting Started

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook T7_193_SMT_Traffic_flow_forecast.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells to perform traffic flow analysis and forecasting

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)
